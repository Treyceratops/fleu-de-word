1) Define required constants
    1.1) define letters allowed to be used
    1.2) define an array of words to use as secret word
    1.3) define flower images in diff states of decay
    1.4) define the most incorrect guesses that can be made

2) Define required variables used to track the state of the game
    2.1) use variable to hold picked random word from array
    2.3) use variable to hold array to show # of empty spaces per word
    2.4) use variable to hold current guessed letter
    2.5) use variable to hold # that tracks wrong guesses
    2.6) use variable to hold true or false depending on whether current guess is in secret word
    2.7) use variable to hold correctly guessed letters
    2.8) use variable to hold incorrectly guessed letters

3) Store elements on the page that will be accessed in code more than once in variables to make code more concise, readable and performant.
    3.1) get display screen from DOM 
    3.2) get reset button from DOM
    3.3) get image div from DOM
    3.4) get keyboard rows from DOM
    3.5) get current guessed word div from DOM

4) Define event listeners on the page that will listen when and action is performed and respond to
    4.1) listen to reset button when clicked, run resetGame function

5) Define functions and their roles when called
    5.1) listen to keyboard being clicked, call functions to:
    handle the click event
    5.2) remove event listener to keyboard
    5.3) set game up to starting state including secret word, image, guess data calls functions to: 
        generate the keyboard,
        add keyboard click event,
        generate cells for secret word
    5.4) resets game to starting state
    5.5) randomize secret word
    5.6) generate keyboard into div cells
    5.7) when keyboard is clicked, call function to: 
        update the current guess
    5.8) sort correct or incorrect guesses, change key color (red for incorrect, green for correct), adds correct results to secret word
    5.9) add letter to secret word when correctly guessed
    5.10) change flower image based on incorrect guesses, call function to:
        hold losing conditions
    5.11) in event of a won game, deactivate keyboard & display win
    5.12) in event of a lost game, deactivate keyboard & display loss
    5.13) call start game state
